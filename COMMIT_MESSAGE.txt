fix: resolve Metro SHA-1 cache error and peer dependency warnings

This commit addresses critical build failures on Vercel caused by Metro bundler
SHA-1 cache errors and peer dependency version mismatches.

Changes:

1. Metro Bundler SHA-1 Cache Error Fix:
   - Created apps/web/scripts/clean-cache.js to remove NativeWind cache directories
   - Updated build script to run cache cleanup before expo export
   - Enhanced metro.config.js with isCSSEnabled: true for proper CSS handling
   - Prevents "SHA-1 for file ... is not computed" errors

2. Peer Dependency Resolution:
   - Aligned vitest versions to 1.6.1 across packages/shared and services/api
   - Added @vitest/ui@1.6.1 to match vitest version
   - Created apps/web/.npmrc with peer dependency auto-resolution
   - Reduces peer dependency warnings during pnpm install

3. Documentation:
   - Created VERCEL_BUILD_FIXES.md with comprehensive resolution summary
   - Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with new sections for these issues
   - Created TESTING_CHECKLIST.md for verification steps
   - Updated .kiro/specs/vercel-local-testing/tasks.md with completion status

Root Cause Analysis:
- NativeWind generates cache files during Metro bundling in pnpm monorepo
- Metro's file watcher discovers dynamically created files but can't compute SHA-1
- pnpm symlinks in monorepo structure exacerbate the timing issue
- Pre-build cache cleanup ensures clean slate before Metro starts

Testing:
- Cache cleanup script verified working locally
- All modified files pass diagnostics checks
- Ready for Vercel deployment testing

Closes: Metro SHA-1 cache error
Closes: Peer dependency version mismatches
